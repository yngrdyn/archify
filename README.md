# archify

<br/>
Do you love User Interfaces? I do, and from some quite time now I've been wanting to enter into architecture world but more focused to User Interfaces. I've been called crazy couple of times mostly in places such reddit, what is an UI architect anyway? Architecture is not target to a specific part of a platform, architecture targets the whole application, the whole system, etc. 
<br/><br/>
I'm aiming to create a knowledge base here for the rare ones out there devoting every bit of their passion to purely User interfaces.
