# archify

<br/>
Do you love User Interfaces? I do, and from some quite time now I've been wanting to enter into architecture world but more focused to User Interfaces. I've been called crazy couple of times mostly in places such reddit, what is an UI architect anyway? Architecture is not target to a specific part of a platform, architecture targets the whole application, the whole system, etc. We have heard about solution Architects, technical Architects, principal Architects but UI architects? 
<br/><br/>
I'm aiming to create a knowledge base here for the rare ones out there devoting every bit of their passion to purely User interfaces.

## Good recipes
* Reduced boilerplate
* Curated library and tools
* Clear implementation and style patterns
* Balance performance with cleanliness

## Patterns
Some of the most common used js patterns, whether they are part of a framework, they are just used in builtin libraries or they are just used unintentionally, are: 
* Model View Controller (MVC)
* Model View VieModel (MVVM)
* Model View Presenter (MVP)
* Presentation Abstraction Control (PAC)
* Event Driven Architecture (EDA)

## Abstractions
Commons abstraction we can perform when working with the ui:
* Rendering sections of the page
* Updating objects with server data
* Presentation data formating
* Validations
* Hanlding states
