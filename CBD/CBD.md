# Component Based Development
Componetization involves breaking software down to loosely coupled pieces that can be writen and deployed independently.
Enfasizes separation of concerns and aims reusability throught components that are connected together.

## Benefits
* Ease collaboration.
* Reusability.
* Accelerate product development.
* Long-term flexibility.

## UI application
So then how can we apply CBD in the UI? Modern user interfaces are built from the bottom up, starting with basic components and then progressively combining them to assemble complex screens.
* Components are reusable, can be moved around and can be placed multiple times without a great effort.
* Each component containerizes its dependencies, api, logic and layout.
